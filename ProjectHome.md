The goal of the project is to create an application for Android devices to access to the services of Souncloud.

For now only "Me" and "Tracks" (partially) is working. The rest of the application is under development.

Please, keep in mind that I am developing the application in the little free time I have, and there is only one person (me) developing it, so be patient about new functionality.
I will try to do my best!.

By the way, I made the tracks on the screenshots: I am an amateur dj and producer ;P .
